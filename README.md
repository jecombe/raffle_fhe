# Raffle FHEvm

This project is a case study. It allows for training in developing on-chain with Zama. The goal is to create a decentralized confidential raffle. A user can create a raffle and define a price. The addresses of the participants are encrypted, as are their amounts. If a user wins the raffle, they receive the tokens associated with that raffle, while the creator of the raffle and the project creator collect fees.
